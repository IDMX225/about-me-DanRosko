What is the About Me Project? The About Me Project is a an intro to the world of webpage design using HTML and CSS. While the About Me project was a way to get an understanding of coding in HTML and CSS, it was also a way to experiment and find styles and designs while also being able to express myself all in one project.

## About Me Project includes:

- Full code of HTML and CSS to build and functional and visually appealing website
- A touch of my personal styling and interests to make use of the website I created
- As well as serves as a reminder of my work and progress made over the semester

## Features
- Throughout the entirety of the web page you will see my chosen color scheme. I wanted to maintain the use of cool color while also keeping it readable. For most of the project you will see the use of #6DDE74 paired with a #darkmagenta border which pops nicely on the brighter green background as well as black for the text to maintain the best readability.
- My about me project begins with a fully functioning navigation bar that will smoothly bring any user to any point of the website.
- Expression along side learning was the most important part of the project. The further down you go, the more you get a peak into my life and interest. My biography section directly followed by hobbies will give a little insight into my life and interests. The creation of Biography and Hobbies was made possible by having smaller h2 tags to differentiate it from the title. Ul and Il lists also made it possible to get information looking organized.
- As we continue, my gallery is filled with photos that I have personally taken all from different parts of my life ranging from cars, nature to food. Not only are the images reactive to different screen sizes, but also styled with their own border and captions.
- The Gallery also uses Image Hover Effects that are explained in the blog with code so that others may use the information to added to their website as well as improve their skills
- As I begin to close off my About me Project we head to my imbedded media which is a youtube video. This was my first introduction to adding media from other websites into my site. While I created the video, learning the process of embedding media is an incredible tool that almost all websites use.
- The final portion of my website is a a fully function contact form. Anyone is able to submit a form and I will be able to see the messages and reply as needed. This form is also completely styled with with CSS and made interactive with HTML
