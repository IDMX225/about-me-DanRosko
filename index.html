            <div>

                <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Rosko. Welcome to my first website created using HTML and CSS</p>

                <p>A little bit about myself. I am currently studying IT and chose to take Web Page Dev because it taught me skills that pertain to my major and interests while also providing the creativity and fun that a lot of STEM class just do not have.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>One of my hobbies includes playing video games. For most of my life I have always had an interest in videos games. My first console being a Playstation 2 and now it feels weird saying I own a Playstation 5. Along side the playstation PC offers and experience like no other when it comes to gaming and I don't think anything will beat it anytime soon. Some of my favorite games currently include the Dark Souls series, Skyrim as well as Racing Simulators.</li>
                <li>Another interest of mine is cooking. I like trying new things to make as well as cooking for friends and family. Some of my favorites things to cook include pizza with homemade sauce and dough as well as steaks and pastas. Shown below in the gallery is one my favorite meals to make.</li>
                <li>Hiking is also one of favorite hobbies of all time. I like finding new places all around New Jersey to just hike or walk around in. Nature walks are always enjoyable. The peace and quite combined with beautiful views always makes for a good time. You can also get a sneak peak at how beautiful New Jersey can be in my Gallery section.</li>
                <li>For as long as I can remember, the only thing I like just as much as playing video games is going fishing. Whether it was with my family or friends, I always had a great time. So much so that me and a few friends got together and bought a boat together.</li>
                <li>I enjoy reading from time to time. Most of what I read is fantasy, sci-fi as well as non-fiction. Over the years some of my favorite books are The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, The Witcher as well as books like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by HUnter S. Thompson</li>
                <li>Another Hobby of mine is listening to music. Whether I'm doing something and want backgorund noise or just want to listen my playlist is always filled with a mix of rock, metal, rap, pop and many more genres.</li>

            <h2>An Excerpt From The Life of Samuel Johnson</h2>

            <div>

                <p>'Colley Cibber, Sir, was by no means a blockhead; but by arrogating to himself too much, he was in danger of losing that degree of estimation to which he was entitled. His friends gave out that he INTENDED his birth-day Odes should be bad: but that was not the case, Sir; for he kept them many months by him, and a few years before he died he shewed me one of them, with great solicitude to render it as perfect as might be, and I made some corrections, to which he was not very willing to submit. I remember the following couplet in allusion to the King and himself:</p>

                <p>"Perch'd on the eagle's soaring wing,</p>

                <p>The lowly linnet loves to sing."</p>

                <p>Sir, he had heard something of the fabulous tale of the wren sitting upon the eagle's wing, and he had applied it to a linnet. Cibber's familiar style, however, was better than that which Whitehead has assumed. GRAND nonsense is insupportable. Whitehead is but a little man to inscribe verses to players.</p>

                <p>'Sir, I do not think Gray a first-rate poet. He has not a bold imagination, nor much command of words. The obscurity in which he has involved himself will not persuade us that he is sublime. His Elegy in a Church-yard has a happy selection of images, but I don't like what are called his great things. His Ode which begins</p>

                <p>"Ruin seize thee, ruthless King,</p>

                <p>Confusion on thy banners wait!"</p>

                <p>has been celebrated for its abruptness, and plunging into the subject all at once. But such arts as these have no merit, unless when they are original. We admire them only once; and this abruptness has nothing new in it. We have had it often before. Nay, we have it in the old song of Johnny Armstrong:</p>
